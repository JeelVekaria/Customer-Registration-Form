# Customer Registration Form
This project is a customer registration page implemented in HTML and Perl for server-side processing. The registration page (lab07b.html) features an HTML form that collects various user information, including name (First, Last), address (street name, city, postal code, province), phone number, email address, and a photograph upload.

## Features
#### HTML Form: 
Create a user-friendly form with fields for name, address, phone number, email, and photograph upload.

#### Province Selection: 
Integrate a drop-down selection option for provinces within the form.

#### Server-Side Processing (lab07b.cgi):
Process form inputs using a server-side Perl script.
Validate user input correctness using regular expressions:
Ensure the phone number is the correct length (10) and only contains numbers.
Validate postal code length (7) and format (e.g., L0L 0L0).
Verify correct email address formatting.

#### Display Page:
Generate a visually attractive display page using CSS.
Display all submitted information in a well-formatted manner.

#### Error Handling:
Highlight user input errors in the display page if any validation issues are detected.
